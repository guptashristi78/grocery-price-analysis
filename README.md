# Grocery Price Analysis Project

This project generates a sample dataset of grocery prices for multiple items,
across different stores and months. It then performs data analysis and 
visualization to find:

- Cheapest store for each item  
- Monthly inflation trend  
- Price stability (Mean, STD, Variance)  
- Item-wise price comparison across stores  
- Overall best (cheapest) store
